# AI Software Engineering Assistant

Welcome to the **AI Software Engineering Assistant**! This project leverages **OpenAI's GPT-4**, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, and automated tools to provide an AI assistant capable of helping with software development tasks such as code generation, refactoring, testing, and continuous learning from past interactions. The assistant serves as an intelligent coding companion to improve efficiency, maintain code quality, and enhance productivity.

## Overview

This project is designed to simulate an AI software engineering intern that can assist with:

- **Generating code** from task descriptions.
- **Modifying and refactoring** code for best practices.
- **Running tests and linting** to ensure quality.
- **Learning continuously** using reinforcement learning by storing experiences in a local database.
- **Providing feedback loops** to improve future interactions based on stored data.

The assistant helps automate repetitive coding tasks, making it easier for software engineers to focus on higher-level development.

## Features

- **Automated Code Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate code based on natural language input.
- **Task Planning**: Automatically breaks down high-level tasks into actionable steps for implementation.
- **Code Refinement**: Enhances the generated code by checking for best practices and fixing issues.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Continuously improves its performance by learning from past experiences using an RL agent.
- **Automated Testing and Linting**: Runs tests and checks for linting errors to maintain code quality.
- **SQLite Database**: Stores all interactions, requests, code versions, and RL experiences for analysis and feedback.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Node.js and npm** (for running JavaScript/React-related tasks)
- **SQLite** (included with Python, but ensure it’s available on your system)
- **OpenAI API Key**: You’ll need an API key to use OpenAI’s services. [Get your API key here](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
